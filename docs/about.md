# About
I am a Senior Information Security Engineer with experience running IR exercises, Appsec, EDR, SIEM, Incident Response, light Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development.

At one point I was the Linux System Administrator for 35 RHEL Linux servers, two Elasticsearch clusters, Graylog and Moloch(now rebranded as Arkime) and I do a little of everything these days.

# My Setup
I use [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/ ) for note taking, Windows for the host, and BlackArch or Kali guests for attacking.

My homelab consists of

- hp DL360 server and a Cisco Catalyst 3750 48 port switch, currently offline

- Windows, Kali, ParrotOS, and BlackArch VMs in vmware player workstation with Windows host

Retro Computing

-  TI Insight Series 10 [terminals-wiki](https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/TI_Insight_Series_10) powers on, crt not working

- 3 windows 98 desktops

- ~10 windows xp systems

- 3 commodore 128s(one working two in need of repair)

# These Notes
I am using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme hosted on [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

Internal links are used where a topic can logically fit in two different places

I may change the site at some point to something that has more flexibility but I keep notes in [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) which this makes extremely simple to maintain

# Projects
The windows 98 systems are in the process of being set up for a retro LAN party, the main one I use has a 1 GHz PIII, 512 MB ram, Voodoo 3500

# Other Interests
I am a licensed glider pilot, licensed falconer and photographer, you can find some photographs [here](https://cara.app/gyrsec) but it is a very limited selection; I am undecided on how best to handle AI as I would prefer none of my photos were used to train a machine learning algorithm.
